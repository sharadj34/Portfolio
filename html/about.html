            <p>Hello everyone! I am a pre-final year college student skilled in C++, HTML, CSS, Dart and Flutter. With a strong foundation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) and Database Management Systems (DBMS) concepts, I am constantly seeking new and innovative ways to solve complex problems.</p>

            <p>I am an active participant on coding platforms like CodeStudio, GeeksForGeeks and LeetCode, where I continuously challenge myself to stay updated with the latest programming trends and hone my skills.</p>

            <p>Apart from coding, I am the Founder and Ex-President of the iOS Club at VIT Bhopal University, where I lead and manage a team of like-minded individuals who shared a passion for app development. As a result of my leadership skills and event management expertise, the club has successfully organized several workshops and hackathons, promoting a culture of learning and collaboration.</p>

            <p>I possess exceptional soft skills, including writing, public speaking, and time management, that have enabled me to excel both in my personal and professional life. </p>

            <p>My consistent academic performance and maintaining a GPA of 8.77 out of 10 reflect my commitment to excellence.</p>
            <br>
